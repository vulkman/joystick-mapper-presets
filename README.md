Presets for the Mac app Joystick Mapper (https://joystickmapper.com)

If you want to play DOSbox games on a Mac using your DualShock 4 PlayStation controller via bluetooth, you will probably need an app like Joystick Mapper.

This repo is where I share my Joystick Mapper mapping files, which you can import by clicking on "File > Open presets folder in Finder" in the app and then just copying the file there.

You can buy the app on the Mac App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joystick-mapper/id528183797
